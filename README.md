## English pronuntiation app

### Idea
A web app that fetch a random quote and ask you to say it and use speech recognition to check your eenglish pronuntiation.

### Status
The app works partially there are issues with speech recognition module, but I won't work on this anymore because I found a app that already does that: https://mycake.me/

I'm not related with cake.
